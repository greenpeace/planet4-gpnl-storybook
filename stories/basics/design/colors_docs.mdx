For web pages the primary colours are supplemented with an orange activation colour and the light green is used for functional navigation elements.Supplementary colours provide depth and variety.

The web colour palette is made up of the main colour palette (Light Green & Dark Green) and the orange as a call to action colour on the buttons. The Light Green is used only in the logo, info action button (read more) or in the thin horizontal line.The Dark Green colour is only used as a support colour on the homepage for the intro.The rest of the site is made up of a series of grey/blue tones that work to separate the different elements on the webpage and create hierarchy.
